  |5/:%&-a3f.:;\     PJON is a device communications bus system that connects up to 255
  \+//u/+g%{osv,,\    arduino boards over one wire up to 5.29kB/s data communication speed.
    \=+&/osw+olds.\\   Contains acknowledge, collision detection, CRC and encpryption all done
       \:/+-.-°-:+oss\  with micros() and delayMicroseconds(), with no use of interrupts or timers.
        | |       \oy\\  Pull down resistor on the bus is generally used to reduce interference.
